### [Project 1-1 Used Cars Market Price Estimator : Web Scraping](https://github.com/Aellawah/Used-Cars-Market-Price-Estimator/blob/main/Notebooks/Used%20Cars%20Market%20Price%20Estimator%20Web%20Scraping.ipynb)
### [Project 1-2 Used Cars Market Price Estimator : Data Analysis & Model Building](https://github.com/Aellawah/Used-Cars-Market-Price-Estimator/blob/main/Notebooks/Used%20Cars%20Market%20Price%20Estimator%20Data%20Analysis%20%26%20Model%20Building.ipynb)

The Used cars market in the past few years has reached a big improvement in the number of Buyers, Sellers and Investors due to the Economic developments that the country has gone through and the nature of the market it self.
This has raised alot of questions about the market and the concern to estimate the different types of used cars prices.

For that purpose i conducted a Data Science project that:

- Created a model that predicts the cars prices in the market (MAE - 14k) to help Buyers,Sellers,Investors satisfy the concern of how much is a car
realtive to it's features according to the market
- Scraped over than 12000 Ads from www.contactcars.com using python and selenium 
- Cleaned and Analyzed data to gain insights about the market.
- Engineerd features from the text of each Ad description & THe Additional features of the cars (Interior Features,Exterior Features,Multimedia Features,Safety Features) to gain more insights about each car
- Applied several models(Linear regression,Decision tree,Random Forest) to reach the best model

This project is part of a virtual internship from KPMG Company

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation which has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy.

- Created a model that predicts the class of each customer (Platinum,Gold,Silver,Bronze) with 99% accuracy to help the company segment it's customers and enhance it's marketing strategy

- In the first notebook the company provided us with three different datasets it's customers transactions,customers demographics and customers addresses so we conducted a Data wrangling on the three datasets and fixed it's quality issues and eventually joined the three datasets together into one big dataset to start analyzing it and answer client's questions

- In the second notebook we made an Exploratory data analysis on the joined datasets and identfied specific trends , and finally i segmented the customers into Four different segments (Platinum,Gold,Silver,Bronze) throught a RFM analysis

- In the third notebook the client provided us with a new customers dataset and asked to recommend which customer to target with our marketing campagins so we used a classification machine learning model and trained our old labelled data on it and fitted it on the new customers data to predict which one will be which segment.

### [Project 3: Linkedin-jobs-Description-Word-embeddings-project](https://github.com/Aellawah/Linkedin-jobs-Description-Word-embeddings-project/blob/main/Linkedin-word2vec-Abdallah.ipynb)
![](/Images/recruit-on-linkedin.png)

I created a word2vec model that takes in a job title and outputs a list of requirements related to that position, it helps the recruiters and the job searchers to be aware of the recent tools and technologies required in the market for different positions
* We Scraped around 1200+ jobs applications and extracted the Description column as a seperate text
* Conducted a NLP preprocessing techniques on the text data
* Finally applied the word2vec model and got an accurate results as outcome


### [Project 4: Quantium Internship :Chips products data analysis](https://github.com/Aellawah/Quantium-Internship-Chips-products-data-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/Quantium%20Internship%20Module%201%20Chips%20products%20data%20analysis.ipynb)
<img src="https://github.com/Aellawah/Quantium-Internship-Chips-products-data-analysis/blob/main/Data%20files/Chips.jpeg">

This project is a part of a virtual internship from Quantium Company

Our client is a company that owns several hypermarkets in the region that sells different types of products, the client wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region.

- Generated thorough insights from the data that will help the company to improve it's business
- Applied data cleaning on both datasets
- Featured Engineered some impportnant columns from the data to reveal more insights
- Joined datasets & Applied Exploratory Data Analysis(Univariate analysis,Bivariate analysis,Multivariate analysis)

### [Project 5: Canadian superstore sales analysis](https://github.com/Aellawah/Canadian-superstore-sales-analysis/blob/main/Canadian%20Superstore%20sales.ipynb)
![](Images/shopping-cart-supermarket-empty-shelves-40320116.jpg)

In this notebook we will explore Data of a canadian superstore that exists in different places around the world and try to gain some insights about the business and the most selling products.

- Answered Some key questions related to the business that would help the stakeholders
- Applied some data cleaning to get the data inshape
- Featued Engineered important information from existing columns
- Revealed some relationships among features
